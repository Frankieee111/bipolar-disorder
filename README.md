# Automatic Recognition of Bipolar Disorder from Multi-modal Data

Bipolar Disorder (BD), a common but serious mental health issue, adversely affects the well-being of individuals, but there exist difficulties in the medical treatment, such as insufficient recognition and delay in the diagnosis. Automatic recognition of bipolar disorder, based on a multi-modal machine learning approach, could help early detection of bipolar disorder and provide an insight into the personalized treatment of bipolar patients. Therefore, this project aims to find the biological descriptors of treatment response and produce an automatic recognition system in bipolar disorder.
