# Introduction

This is the introduction where you should introduce your work.  In
general the thing to aim for here is to describe a little bit of the
context for your work --- why did you do it (motivation), what was the
hoped-for outcome (aims) --- as well as trying to give a brief
overview of what you actually did.

It's often useful to bring forward some ``highlights'' into 
this chapter (e.g.\ some particularly compelling results, or 
a particularly interesting finding). 

It's also traditional to give an outline of the rest of the
document, although without care this can appear formulaic 
and tedious. Your call. 


# Background

A more extensive coverage of what's required to understand your 
work. In general you should assume the reader has a good undergraduate 
degree in computer science, but is not necessarily an expert in 
the particular area you've been working on. Hence this chapter 
may need to summarize some ``text book'' material. 

This is not something you'd normally require in an academic paper, 
and it may not be appropriate for your particular circumstances. 
Indeed, in some cases it's possible to cover all of the ``background'' 
material either in the introduction or at appropriate places in 
the rest of the dissertation. 


# Related Work

This chapter covers relevant (and typically, recent) research 
which you build upon (or improve upon). There are two complementary 
goals for this chapter: 

* to show that you know and understand the state of the art; and 
* to put your work in context

Ideally you can tackle both together by providing a critique of
related work, and describing what is insufficient (and how you do
better!)

The related work chapter should usually come either near the front or
near the back of the dissertation. The advantage of the former is that
you get to build the argument for why your work is important before
presenting your solution(s) in later chapters; the advantage of the
latter is that don't have to forward reference to your solution too
much. The correct choice will depend on what you're writing up, and
your own personal preference.


# Design and Implementation

This chapter may be called something else but in general 
the idea is that you have one (or a few) ``meat'' chapters which
describe the work you did in technical detail. 


# Evaluation

For any practical projects, you should almost certainly have
some kind of evaluation, and it's often useful to separate 
this out into its own chapter.


# Summary and Conclusion

As you might imagine: summarizes the dissertation, and draws 
any conclusions. Depending on the length of your work, and 
how well you write, you may not need a summary here. 

You will generally want to draw some conclusions, and point
to potential future work.
